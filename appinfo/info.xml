	<name>External storage support for MOE</name>
	<description>
	This application enables administrators to configure connections to external storage providers(GoogleDrive,Dropbox,Onedrive). Administrators can choose which types of storage to enable and can mount these storage locations for a user, a group, or the entire system. Users will see a new folder appear in their root ownCloud directory, which they can access and use like any other ownCloud folder. External Storage also allows users to share files stored in these external locations. In these cases, the credentials for the owner of the file are used when the recipient requests the file from external storage, thereby ensuring that the recipient can access the shared file.
	
	External Storage can be configured using the GUI or at the command line. This second option provides the advanced user with more flexibility for configuring bulk external storage mounts and setting mount priorities. More information is available in the External Storage GUI documentation and the External Storage Configuration File documentation.
